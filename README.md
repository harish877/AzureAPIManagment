# Sample Code
Terraform azure API

managed to provision the APIM with Terraform, which is creating the resource and configuring.

So now we can just edit the swagger.json or better, re-generate the swagger.json, and simply do a “terraform apply”, 
that works as a mix of a provision/deployment, and it allows us to create a streamlined Terraform pipeline to make changes 
in the APIM/API definitions
